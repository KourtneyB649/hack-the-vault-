# Hack the Vault – A Cybersecurity Minigame

This project is my final submission for Stanford’s **Code in Place University 2025**.

## 🎯 About the Game
**Hack the Vault** is a Python-based minigame where players take on the role of a hacker trying to crack a randomly generated vault passcode. After each guess, the program gives feedback about how many digits are correct and whether they’re in the correct position.

## 💡 Features
- Difficulty level selection (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Feedback after each guess (correct digit, correct position)
- Attempt limit with a win or loss message
- Clean, readable code with comments

## 🛠️ How to Play
1. Run the program in a Python environment (3.x).
2. Select your difficulty (3, 4, or 6-digit code).
3. Try to guess the randomly generated vault code.
4. Use the feedback after each guess to help you figure out the correct code before running out of attempts.

## 🧑‍💻 Built With
- Python 3
- VS Code (Visual Studio Code)

## 🚀 Purpose
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- Functions
- Loops and conditionals
- User input validation
- Random number generation
- Debugging outside of a teaching platform
